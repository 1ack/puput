# Puput

Puput is a powerful and simple Django app to manage a blog. It uses the awesome Wagtail CMS as content management system.

Puput is the catalan name for [Hoopoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoopoe) which is indeed a beautiful bird.

### Setup

1. Add to `PUPUT_APPS` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py` file. It also includes Wagtail apps and other dependencies.

    ```
    from puput import PUPUT_APPS
    
    INSTALLED_APPS +=  PUPUT_APPS
    ```
2. Add Wagtail required middleware classes

    ```
    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
        ...
        'wagtail.wagtailcore.middleware.SiteMiddleware',
        'wagtail.wagtailredirects.middleware.RedirectMiddleware',
    )
    ```
3. Place Puput urls at the __bottom__ of the urlpatterns. It also includes Wagtail urls.

    ```
        urlpatterns = [
            ...
            url(r'', include('puput.urls')),
        ]
    ```
4. Run `python manage.py migrate`
5. Open your broswer at http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/ to view your blog home page. 

### Setup (as Wagtail plugin)

1. Add `puput` and `endless_pagination` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py` file.
2. If you have previously defined Wagtail urls in `urls.py` set `PUPUT_AS_PLUGIN = True` in the `settings.py`. This will avoid to include Wagtail urls again when you include necessary Puput urls.
3. Include Puput urls in your `urls.py` file.

    ```
        urlpatterns = [
            ...
            url(r'', include('puput.urls')),
        ]
    ```
4. Run `python manage.py migrate`
 

### Manage your content

Puput uses the default Wagtail CMS admin page in order to manage the content of the blog. It provides a powerful, clean and modern interface. Just open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog_admin/.

This is how adding entry page looks:

Please visit [Wagtail: an Editorâ€™s guide](http://docs.wagtail.io/en/v1.0/editor_manual/index.html) for details of how to use Wagtail editor's dashboard.

### Comments

Puput uses django-disqus by default to display a comment box in every blog entry. Simply add `DISQUS_API_KEY` and `DISQUS_WEBSITE_SHORTNAME` to `settings.py`. See [django-disqus official documentation](http://django-disqus.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html#configuring-your-django-installation) for more info.

### TODO

* Tests
* More documentation
* Remove django-endless-pagination package which is no longer mantained
* Caching
